# Meta Mind Token (MTAM)

## Description

This is a simple Ethereum token contract written in Solidity. The contract allows for the creation and destruction of tokens, with balances being tracked on-chain.

## Contract Details

- **Name**: Meta Mind
- **Symbol**: MTAM
- **Total Supply**: Initially 0, can be increased by minting

## Functions

- **mint(address _address, uint256 _value)**: This function allows you to create new tokens and add them to the total supply. The newly minted tokens are added to the balance of the `_address` provided.
- **burn(address _address, uint256 _value)**: This function allows you to destroy tokens, reducing the total supply. Tokens are burned from the balance of the `_address` provided.

## Getting Started

To interact with this contract, you will need an Ethereum wallet and some Ether to pay for transaction fees. You can then deploy the contract to the Ethereum network using a service like [Remix](https://remix.ethereum.org/).
